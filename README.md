"# invaluable_links" 


To avoid going back through all my history files of youtube to find some random invaluable links i found on the internet, when it came to my head after several months.

Need a page in my blog to display this data and let other put up and down votes if they found it valuable.

This is key : value store which has key as the name of the link's category and value as  the dictionary which contain list of alphabetically ordered links with their respective names eventually this should be json file.
